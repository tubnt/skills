description: Project development lifecycle management with a strict three-phase workflow (investigate -> proposal -> implement), file-based plan tracking in docs/plan/, task tracking in docs/task/, and claim-before-work multi-agent coordination. Use when handling feature development, bug fixes, refactors, planning, progress tracking, or multi-agent execution in an existing codebase.

# PMA - Project Management Assistant

Run delivery work with clear gates, minimal diffs, and explicit task/plan tracking.

## Hard Rules

1. All conversation output, generated documents, task files, plan files, commit messages, and PR content MUST be in Chinese. Skill definitions and config files stay in English.
2. Use English filenames only (e.g. `architecture.md`, `changelog.md`).
3. Read before write: inspect call chains, related config/tests, and recent changelog context before editing logic.
4. Make only the minimal requested changes; do not add unrequested refactors or features.
5. Never use plan mode (`EnterPlanMode`, `mode: "plan"`). Manage plans in `docs/plan/` files only.
6. Do not implement before explicit confirmation (`proceed`).

## Three-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Investigation

1. Trace upstream/downstream call chains, symbol references, and types.
2. Search related code, config, tests, migrations, and docs.
3. Read the tail of `docs/changelog.md` for recent context.
4. Find or create the matching task in `docs/task/index.md` and claim it (`[-]`).

Non-trivial task rule:
- If the change touches `>=3` files or crosses modules, create `docs/plan/PLAN-NNN.md` and write findings to the context section.

### Phase 2: Proposal

Output these items (in Chinese), then stop for approval:
- Current state
- Proposal
- Risks
- Scope
- Alternatives (if multiple approaches exist)

For non-trivial tasks:
- Complete remaining sections in `PLAN-NNN.md`.
- Append one line to `docs/plan/index.md` with `[ ]`.
- Wait for user annotations and address all of them before implementation.

### Phase 3: Implement -> Verify -> Record

Only after approval:

1. If a plan exists, set plan index marker to `[-]` and detail `status` to `implementing`.
2. Implement step by step according to the approved proposal.
3. Run focused self-verification (compile, test, deploy verification, etc.).
4. Set task index marker to `[x]` and task detail `status` to `completed`.
5. If a plan exists, set plan index marker to `[x]` and plan detail `status` to `completed`.
6. Update changelog as needed.

## Task and Plan Files

Use these canonical references instead of redefining formats in-place:

- Task format: [docs/task-format.md](docs/task-format.md)
- Plan format: [docs/plan-format.md](docs/plan-format.md)

Required structure:

- `docs/task/index.md`: one-line task entries
- `docs/task/PREFIX-NNN.md`: task detail files
- `docs/plan/index.md`: one-line plan entries
- `docs/plan/PLAN-NNN.md`: plan detail files

## Claim-Before-Work (Multi-Agent Safety)

Before writing any implementation code:

1. Read `docs/task/index.md`; for `[-]` items, read detail `owner`.
2. If another agent owns the in-progress task, skip it.
3. Claim atomically:
   - Update task index `[ ] -> [-]`
   - Update task detail `status -> in_progress`, set `owner`
   - Call `TaskUpdate(status: "in_progress", owner: "<agent>")` if task tools are available
4. Start implementation only after the claim is fully written.

On completion:
- Set task index `[-] -> [x]`
- Set task detail `status -> completed`

On close/won't do:
- Set task index to `[~]`
- Set task detail `status -> closed` and record reason

## Sync Rules

Task status updates are immediate, never deferred.

- Primary source is files in `docs/task/` and `docs/plan/`.
- If `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` tools are available, keep tool state in sync with file state.
- If task tools are unavailable, continue with file-only sync and state this in the progress update.

Session checklist:
1. Session start: read `docs/task/index.md`, active task details, and `docs/plan/index.md`.
2. New task: create detail file first, then append index line.
3. Before work: complete Claim-Before-Work.
4. Session end: verify statuses are written and update index header date.

## Changelog Conventions

Entry format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [tag]

[content in Chinese]
```

Recommended tags:
- `[进度]`, `[BUG-P0]`, `[BUG-P1]`, `[踩坑]`, `[决策]`

## Project Initialization

On first use in a project:

1. Ensure `docs/task/index.md` exists (initialize from [docs/task-format.md](docs/task-format.md)).
2. Ensure `docs/plan/index.md` exists (initialize from [docs/plan-format.md](docs/plan-format.md)).
3. Ensure `docs/changelog.md` exists.

## PR Workflow

### Creating a PR

1. Analyze **full** commit history from branch point, not just the latest commit.
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to review all changes.
3. Title: under 70 characters, in Chinese.
4. Body format:
   ```
   ## 概要
   <1-3 bullet points>

   ## 测试计划
   - [ ] <checklist items>
   ```
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch.

### Auto-Review Before PR

Run these checks automatically before creating or updating a PR:

1. **Code review** — review all changed files.
2. **Security scan** — check for hardcoded secrets, input validation, injection vulnerabilities, error message leaks.
3. **Build verification** — ensure build passes.
4. **Tests** — run test suite; verify no regressions.

If any check fails, fix the issue before creating the PR. Do not skip checks with `--no-verify`.
